Hello, mimicore3.1 is a .NET core web application. It is built in Visual Studio 2019 with .NET Core 3.1.

In this application it is using Vue as the front end framework to build a SPA (Single Page Application).

It has a lot of pain and fun to build this app. I will list them in the future...

Wait for me!
